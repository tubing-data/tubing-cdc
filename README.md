# tubing-cdc
When I joined the second company in my career, I was assigned to build a CDC system. At that time, I realized that when the amount of data in the enterprise was gradually increasing, such a system was needed to handle data synchronization related work, but before that, we needed a lightweight solution. This project aims to design a lightweight, out-of-the-box system to help the booming system quickly establish a data synchronization module.
